# Cloud Fundamentals

## Understanding Cloud Computing
### Benefits of Cloud Computing
- Agility üèÉ
    - You can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes, and get from the idea to implementation serveral orders of magnitude faster than before. This gives you the **freedom to experiment, test new ideas to differentiate customer experiences, and transform your business**.
- Elasticity üìà
    - You don't have to over-provision resources up front to handle peak levels of business activity in the future. Instead, you provision the amount of resources that you actually need. **You can scale these resources up or down to instantly grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change**.
- Cost Savings üè¶
    - **The cloud allows you to trade capital expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it**. Plus, the variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself because of the economies of scale.
- Deploy Globally in Minutes üåé
    - With the cloud, **you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes**. Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their experience.
### Types of Cloud Computing
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
